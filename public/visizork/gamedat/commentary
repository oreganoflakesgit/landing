# Game commentary source.

ABOUT: Welcome to the commentary track!

const:ZORK-NUMBER: The number of the Zorks shall be one.
	(“Three, sir!”)
	Yes, but *this* one is Zork 1.

rtn:V-VERSION: Print the title, release, and serial number.
	This function is shared between all three Zorks, which is why it has code to print all three titles. The passages meant for Zork 2 and 3 were ignored when compiling Zork 1. (Skipped code is shown in grey.)

src:GVERBS-90: The TRS-80 interpreter set a special bit which told the game to change certain behavior for no-doubt-contractual reasons. For Zork 1, it adds the line “Licensed to Tandy Corporation”, and also skips [mentioning Zork 2/3|~src:1ACTIONS-390] at the end.
	For a complete list of “Tandy bit” behavior changes in Infocom games, [see this page|https://ifarchive.org/if-archive/infocom/info/tandy_bits.html].

src:1ACTIONS-390: On the TRS-80, this skips mentioning Zork 2/3. See [V-VERSION|*src:GVERBS-90].

objtree-legend: In this list, `Rooms` are rooms and `Items` are regular items. (Sometimes portable, sometimes not.)
	`Scen` indicates scenery objects. These exist in multiple places; for example, the [~obj:WHITE-HOUSE] is visible from many outdoor locations. Sometimes as “You can’t see that from here”, but it’s the same object.
	`Glob` indicates a global object, which is *always* visible, or at least mentionable. For example, [~obj:GRUE] is global – not because grues are always present, but so you can always ask `WHAT IS A GRUE`.

obj:local-globals: This is a container for scenery objects like [~obj:WHITE-HOUSE], which are visible from many locations in the game.

src:gglobals-26: This refers to the word `ZZMGCK` in [~obj:local-globals], above.
	Why is this synonym necessary? Does it need to be alphabetically last? Not clear! Most Infocom games have it (or a variation), but some say “No, this synonym doesn’t need to exist” instead.
	If you type `EXAMINE ZZMGCK`, the parser finds [~obj:local-globals]. But that object is nameless, so you get a garbage reply. Go on, try it.

obj:adventurer: Yes, the player’s printed name is “cretin”, although the game rarely says so. (The death message for `BURN BOOK` mentions it.) This sort of sarcastic insult hasn’t aged too well, but MIT culture had a lot of it. Compare [*glob:WINNER], and also the old MIT [Jargon File|https://jargon-file.org/archive/jargon-1.0.0.33.dos.txt].
	Note that if you refer to `ME` (or `CRETIN`), you get the [*obj:ME] global object, not the `ADVENTURER`.

obj:me: A global object which is always in scope. Commands referring to `ME` hit this, rather than [*obj:ADVENTURER], which is a stub that moves around the map.
	Because of this, parser messages mostly refer to you as “you”, even though the [*obj:ADVENTURER]’s printed name is “cretin”.

glob:player: `PLAYER` is always the [~obj:ADVENTURER]. Compare [*glob:WINNER].

glob:winner: `WINNER` is the actor in the current command. (Compare [*glob:PLAYER].) 
	`WINNER` is usually [~obj:ADVENTURER], but for a command like `ROBOT, GO EAST` it shifts to the named NPC. (But Zork 1 has no commandable NPCs, so this doesn’t come up.)
	“Winner” is just as sarcastic as “[cretin|*obj:adventurer]”, but from the other side.

glob:here: The location of the [*glob:WINNER].

glob:lit: Whether the current location has light. Set by calling the [rtn:LIT?] routine.

glob:always-lit: Whether the player is inherently emitting light. This is set when you are dead, so that you can move spectrally around the world without carrying a light source.

rtn:LIT?: Determine whether the current location has light. This is true if the room or anything in it has [attr:ONBIT]. It’s also true if the player is [glob:ALWAYS-LIT].
	This routine is always used to set the [glob:LIT] variable.

glob:sprayed?: Whether you’ve been sprayed with grue repellant. Sadly, the grue repellant is in Zork 2, so this will never be set.

glob:troll-flag: Set if the [~obj:TROLL] is dead or unconscious.

glob:cyclops-flag: Set if the [~obj:CYCLOPS] is scared off or unconscious. (See also [*glob:magic-flag].)

glob:magic-flag: Set if the [~obj:CYCLOPS] has been scared off, thus breaking down the door in the [~obj:LIVING-ROOM]. (See also [*glob:cyclops-flag].)
	Why “magic”? Why not, I guess.

glob:false-flag: Always false. See [*obj:kitchen].

glob:load-allowed: The total weight you can carry (see [rtn:WEIGHT]). This is normally the same as [~glob:LOAD-MAX], but it decreases when you’re wounded.

glob:low-direction: Properties with this value and above are directions.

attr:onbit: Set for glowing objects and naturally-illuminated rooms.
	This is different from [attr:LIGHTBIT], which indicates objects that the player can `TURN ON`. See also [attr:FLAMEBIT], objects which are on fire.

attr:flamebit: Set for objects which are on fire. Such objects normally also have [attr:ONBIT].
	This is different from [attr:BURNBIT], which indicates objects that the player can `BURN`.

attr:lightbit: Set for objects which the player can sensibly `TURN ON` (e.g. the [~obj:lamp]).
	This is different from [attr:ONBIT], which indicates objects that are currently lit up. See also [attr:BURNBIT], objects which the player can `BURN`.

attr:burnbit: Set for objects which the player can `BURN`. (It might be a bad idea, but you can do it.)
	This is different from [attr:FLAMEBIT], which indicates objects that are currently on fire. See also [attr:LIGHTBIT], objects which the player can `TURN ON`.

attr:rlandbit: Set for rooms which are dry land. (Most of them.) The opposite is [attr:nonlandbit].

attr:nonlandbit: Set for rooms which are flooded. These can only be traversed with the [boat|~obj:inflatable-boat].

attr:mazebit: Set for rooms in the twisty maze (but not the coal mine maze).
	This flag is the basis for the thief’s [maze-shuffling taunt|rtn:ROB-MAZE].

attr:sacredbit: Indicates objects the thief will not touch, and rooms where the thief will not go.

src:GVERBS-1593: Not until Sorcerer!

src:1actions-707: If you throw the [~obj:TROLL] a weapon, he has a 20% chance of eating it and dying. (Taking the weapon with him.)
	In the very earliest version of MIT Zork (June 1977), this was the intended way to kill the troll. (He had a higher chance of eating the knife.) By December 1977, this was replaced with the familiar hand-to-hand combat code. But at some point the “internal hemorrhage” was added back into the commercial Zork 1 as an alternate solution.

rtn:ROB-MAZE: If you leave objects around the maze (as a mapping aid), and the thief discovers them, he is supposed to mess with them. And taunt you about it.
	Unfortunately, this version of Zork has a bug, so this never happens. See [DESCRIBE-ROOM|src:GVERBS-1564].

src:GVERBS-1564: [~rtn:DESCRIBE-ROOM] always marks `MAZEBIT` rooms as unvisited. This means that they are always described in full, even in `BRIEF` mode. You can’t “recognize” maze rooms you’ve already visited.
	Unfortunately, this breaks the [rtn:ROB-MAZE] routine. The thief is supposed to move your possessions around the maze behind your back. But he doesn’t touch unvisited rooms, so this never happens!
	(c:Torbjörn Andersson)

glob:c-ints: Indicates how much of the timer table ([*glob:C-TABLE]) is used. This counts down from `C-TABLELEN`, which is 180.

glob:c-table: The timer table. See the “Timers” tab for a current listing.

timers-legend: A list of the timers running (or paused) in the timer table ([~glob:C-TABLE]). Positive numbers count down (while enabled) and call the named function after that many turns. Negative numbers are called every turn while the timer is enabled.
	This list only grows as you play; timers can be added, started, and stopped, but not removed.
	Note that enabled negative timers, like [*rtn:I-THIEF], count down towards “negative infinity”. They’ll wrap and stop working after 65535 turns, but back then nobody worried about this!

glob:c-demons: Indicates how much of the timer table is used for daemons. The difference between daemons and timers is that timers run every turn; daemons run every *input*, even if no turn passes. But Zork does not use daemons.

glob:p-won: Set if the parser successfully parsed a command. (As opposed to a blank line or an error.)
	No relation to whether the *player* has won; that’s [*glob:WON-FLAG].

rtn:GWIM: “Get What I Mean”. The parser uses this to infer a missing object or ask a disambiguation question.

glob:p-gwimbit: A filter used when [*rtn:GWIM] searches for objects. For example, for an `IGNITE` command, `P-GWIMBIT` would be set to [attr:FLAMEBIT] so the parser can search for a *flaming* object.

glob:won-flag: Set when you reach 350 points. See [rtn:SCORE-UPD].
	Oddly, this global is defined in two places in the source. See [gverbs.zil|~src:GVERBS-1743].

src:GVERBS-1743: This global is also defined in [1dungeon.zil|*glob:won-flag]. The compiler seems to have been okay with this.

glob:lucky: Set false if you break a mirror. Yes, this hurts probability checks; see [~rtn:ZPROB].
	Oddly, this global is defined in two places in the source. See [1actions.zil|~src:1ACTIONS-940]. (Don’t worry, `T` and `1` are the same value.)
	
src:1ACTIONS-940: This global is also defined in [gverbs.zil|*glob:lucky]. The compiler seems to have been okay with this. (Don’t worry, `T` and `1` are the same value.)

rtn:score-upd: Increases (or decreases) your score. Also checks whether you’ve reached 350, which sets [glob:WON-FLAG] and unlocks the secret [~obj:MAP] and the [~obj:STONE-BARROW].
	(You can get your score up to 352 by exploiting a [bug|src:1ACTIONS-3798]. Sadly, this routine only checks if your score is `EQUAL?` to 350. Going over will not end the game!)

glob:lamp-table: This table shows the successive stages of the lamp going out. The *first* stage is 200 turns, which is set in [~rtn:GO], not here.

rtn:i-lantern: This routine sits in the timers table. When it fires, it prints a “lantern has gotten dimmer” message and re-queues itself for the next dimming stage. (Until the lantern goes out entirely, of course.) The messages themselves (and their durations) are found in [*glob:lamp-table].

glob:candle-table: This table shows the successive stages of the candles burning down. The *first* stage is 40 turns, which is set in [~rtn:GO], not here.

rtn:i-candles: This routine sits in the timers table. When it fires, it prints a “candles have gotten shorter” message and re-queues itself for the next shortening stage. (Until the candles burn out entirely, of course.) The messages themselves (and their durations) are found in [*glob:candle-table].
	Even though the candles begin the game lit, they politely don’t start counting down until you pick them up.

rtn:i-sword: This routine runs every turn that you are carrying the sword. It checks adjacent rooms for enemies and displays the “sword is glowing” message.
	The sword’s glow level is stored in its `TVALUE` property, which is normally used for treasure values. This might lead to a score exploit if you could put the glowing sword in the trophy case. But that’s impossible, right?
	Wrong! See [this bug|src:1ACTIONS-3798].

src:1ACTIONS-3798: The sword’s glow level is only updated while you’re carrying it. If you put it in a large container (the [~obj:COFFIN] or [~obj:INFLATED-BOAT]) and carry *that* around, the sword will glow forever.
	Since the glow level is stored in its `TVALUE` property, this means you can put it into the trophy case and score two “impossible” points. This lets you win the game with 352 points. See [this forum post|https://intfiction.org/t/causes-of-zombification-in-zork-i-and-possibly-other-infocom-games/53439/36].
	(c:Torbjörn Andersson)

rtn:i-thief: This routine is the [~obj:THIEF]’s heartbeat; it runs every turn until you kill him. (Or knock him unconscious.) It handles all of the thief’s movement and, well, thieving activity.
	The thief moves in a regular round through the dungeon. This is not defined by room connections; rather, it’s the order that rooms appear in the [~obj:ROOMS] container.
	The thief is normally stealthy – the `INVISIBLE` flag, which also prevents the [SWORD|*rtn:I-SWORD] from detecting him. He has a chance of appearing when he enters your location; see [~rtn:THIEF-VS-ADVENTURER].

rtn:i-fight: This routine handles the turn-by-turn behavior of hostile creatures. This includes [attacking you|rtn:DO-FIGHT], as the name implies, but also waking up after you’ve knocked them out.

rtn:do-fight: Run through the table of [~glob:VILLAINS] and have each one attack you, if appropriate.

rtn:GO: Set up the world at the start of the game. Start the timers. Print the banner. Set all those useful globals like [~glob:HERE] and [~glob:PLAYER].


glob:house-around: If you type `WALK AROUND HOUSE` while standing near the house, this table takes you in a neat circle around it.

glob:in-house-around: If you type `WALK AROUND HOUSE` while standing *inside* the house... it doesn’t work because the [~obj:WHITE-HOUSE] scenery object isn’t visible. There’s a [bit of code|~src:1ACTIONS-93] which wants to use this table but it never runs.

glob:forest-around: If you type `WALK AROUND FOREST` while in the forest, this table takes you for a nice (non-random) ramble.

glob:above-ground: If you die, your possessions are scattered above ground according to this table. See [rtn:RANDOMIZE-OBJECTS].

rtn:I-FOREST-ROOM: Timer event for occasional birdsong while you are in the forest.

rtn:RANDOMIZE-OBJECTS: If you die, your possessions are scattered above ground. Except for the lamp (always found in the [~obj:LIVING-ROOM]) and the coffin (returned to the [~obj:EGYPT-ROOM]).

obj:mountains: The game scale gets a bit loose here.

obj:kitchen: The `DOWN` exit implies that you *could* go down if [~glob:FALSE-FLAG] were true, but of course it never is. In fact `FALSE-FLAG` has no other use in the game but blocking this exit. It’s not clear why it’s set up this way, rather than an unconditional failure message.
	(Possibly so the sword will glow if the thief is passing through the [~obj:STUDIO] below? But the thief is normally `INVISIBLE` and does not trigger the sword.)
	This has the side effect that `JUMP` in the Kitchen is fatal. See [V-LEAP|*src:GVERBS-769].

obj:garlic: Who carries around one clove of garlic? As a kid, I assumed this was a *head* of garlic, which left me permanently confused about what “clove” meant. Thanks Zork.

obj:trap-door: This object is defined as being `IN` the [~obj:LIVING-ROOM], but is also in the scenery list (the `GLOBAL` property) of the [~obj:CELLAR]. This isn’t very interesting, I admit.

obj:egg: This egg is not an easter egg.

obj:songbird: The songbird is always present but never in reach. Except when using the [CANARY|~rtn:CANARY-OBJECT], and even then the bird flies away before you can interact with it.

obj:teeth: Why teeth? Because you can `BRUSH TEETH`, which isn’t interesting, but then you can `BRUSH TEETH WITH GUNK`, because the tube is described as “like a tube of toothpaste”. Spoiler: it’s a bad idea.

src:1DUNGEON-22: But why is `OVERBOARD` listed as a synonym of `TEETH`? Because the game accepts `THROW OBJECT OVERBOARD` (if you’re in the boat), and it does it by a terrible hack.
	The grammar table includes [THROW OBJECT OBJECT|~src:GSYNTAX-475]. The [rtn:V-OVERBOARD] routine then checks whether the second object is the `TEETH`. The `TEETH` are global, meaning they’re always available. By sneaking the synonym `OVERBOARD` into the teeth, the game can check the validity of that second word without defining a whole new object.

rtn:V-OVERBOARD: Why the `TEETH` check? Because of a [sneaky grammar hack|src:1DUNGEON-22].
	This routine has a rather silly bug. You can type `THROW OBJECT OVERBOARD` (if you’re sailing the boat), but nothing checks that the object is *portable*. So you can throw `GRUE` or `HANDS` or `ADVENTURER` overboard, with unfortunate effects on the game grammar.
	(c:Torbjörn Andersson)

src:GSYNTAX-475: The second object has to be `OVERBOARD`. See the note about [TEETH|src:1DUNGEON-22].

obj:granite-wall: This object is global, but the granite wall is described as being between the [~obj:NORTH-TEMPLE] and the [~obj:TREASURE-ROOM]. And then the [~obj:SLIDE-ROOM] has the *words* “Granite Wall”.
	What’s going on? Well, it turns out that you can transport yourself through the granite wall. Typing the magic word `TREASURE` (or `TEMPLE`) will move you from the `NORTH-TEMPLE` to the `TREASURE-ROOM` and back. This is completely ridiculous as a puzzle – *nobody* figures it out – so it’s good that there are two other ways to get past the [~obj:CYCLOPS].

rtn:v-treasure: A very obscure magic word. See [*obj:granite-wall].

src:1actions-514: Who slams the trap door on you, anyhow? It must be the thief, the only mobile NPC in the game. But the thief is never seen above ground. And (to be really persnickety) the trap door slams even after the thief is dead.
	Really, we should assume it’s the Dungeon Master, who has a vested interest in your underground quest.

obj:chimney: This is one of several places where the MIT kids used caving jargon without quite conveying that they knew what it meant. A “[climbable chimney|~rtn:CHIMNEY-F]” would have meant something very different to Will and Patricia Crowther.

obj:bones: The idea of encountering your earlier self’s luckless corpse will reappear in *Trinity*.

obj:lowered-basket: The object names are misleading. `RAISED-BASKET` represents the basket at *this* end of the shaft, where you can interact with it. `LOWERED-BASKET` represents the basket at the *other* end of the shaft. When you raise or lower the basket, the two objects swap places.

glob:LIGHT-SHAFT: The score bonus for bringing light to the [dark room|~obj:LOWER-SHAFT].

glob:EMPTY-HANDED: This is only checked for the passage between the [~obj:TIMBER-ROOM] and the [~obj:LOWER-SHAFT]. Therefore it is only computed when in those two rooms. See [~rtn:NO-OBJS].

rtn:maze-diodes: This function defines one-way down-crawls in the maze. (Diodes are electrical components that pass current only one way.)

obj:maze-1: Everybody loves a maze.
	[Enter the maze|com-maze-1]?

com-maze-1: You are in a maze of twisty little passages, all different.
	You can go [north|com-maze-11], [east|com-maze-9], [west|com-maze-10], [northwest|com-maze-8], or [up|com-maze-7].

com-maze-2: You are in a little maze of twisting passages, all different.
	You can go [south|com-maze-12], [northwest|com-maze-6], [southwest|com-maze-3], [southeast|com-maze-7], or [up|com-maze-11].

com-maze-3: You are in a maze of twisting little passages, all different.
	You can go [east|com-maze-2], [northeast|com-maze-7], [southeast|com-maze-4], or [up|com-maze-8].

com-maze-4: You are in a little maze of twisty passages, all different.
	You can go [north|com-maze-5], [northeast|com-maze-9], [southwest|com-maze-8], or [up|com-maze-3].

com-maze-5: You are in a twisting maze of little passages, all different.
	You can go [north|com-maze-9], [west|com-maze-4], [northeast|com-maze-6], or [northwest|com-maze-10].

com-maze-6: You are in a twisting little maze of passages, all different.
	You can go [west|com-maze-11], [southeast|com-maze-5], [southwest|com-maze-2], or [up|com-maze-10].

com-maze-7: You are in a twisty little maze of passages, all different.
	You can go [north|com-maze-1], [west|com-maze-8], [northeast|com-maze-10], [southeast|com-maze-3], or [up|com-maze-2].

com-maze-8: You are in a twisty maze of little passages, all different.
	You can go [east|com-maze-1], [west|com-maze-3], [south|com-maze-7], [northwest|com-maze-9], or [up|com-maze-4].

com-maze-9: You are in a little twisty maze of passages, all different.
	You can go [north|com-maze-8], [south|com-maze-4], [southwest|com-maze-10], [southeast|com-maze-1], or [down|com-maze-5].

com-maze-10: You are in a maze of little twisting passages, all different.
	You can go [west|com-maze-6], [southeast|com-maze-9], [southwest|com-maze-11], [up|com-maze-5], or [down|com-maze-1].

com-maze-11: You are in a maze of little twisty passages, all different.
	You can go [north|com-maze-6], [south|com-maze-10], [northeast|com-maze-2], [southwest|com-maze-1], or [down|com-maze-7].

com-maze-12: You have reached a dead end. There is a massive vending machine here.
	[Press the button|BATTERIES] to receive fresh batteries for your lantern!

batteries: Your lantern is now refreshed.
	(Take a look at the “Timers” tab.)

obj:dam-room: The reservoir is underground (dark), but the dam and the river downstream are sunlit. (You can tell by the [~obj:RAINBOW], and also by not needing a light source.) This is hard to visualize.
	In MIT Zork, the [~obj:CANYON-VIEW] says “I can discern the top of the Flood Control Dam #3 far to the distant north.” By this version that has changed to “The mighty Frigid River flows out from a great dark cavern,” thus hanging a lantern on the problem.

obj:bubble: This is a slightly quirky concept. The whole point of the “green bubble” is that it’s a *light bulb*, but you don’t know that because you’re a fantasy adventurer character.
	But you *do* know what “plastic” is! Not to mention a battery-powered lantern. Zork’s patchwork setting is part of its charm, but here it trips up.

obj:canyon-view: The mighty Frigid River runs aboveground until it doesn’t. See [*obj:DAM-ROOM].

obj:atlantis-room: A very evocative room considering that the only detail is the [~obj:trident]’s description! I always imagined Byzantine undersea murals, but that was just me.
	The text implies that the room was exposed when you drained the reservoir, which is not really true. (You can check this by arriving by [mirror|~rtn:MIRROR-MIRROR].)

obj:COFFIN: Do you know how much a solid gold sarcophagus would weigh? More than 55, that’s for sure.
	The real Ramses II was buried in gilded *wood* coffin inside an alabaster sarcophagus inside a larger granite sarcophagus. A fragment of the granite one was identified [just last year|https://www.smithsonianmag.com/smart-news/ramses-II-long-lost-sarcophagus-finally-been-identified-180984441/]!

glob:COFFIN-CURE: Set if you’re *not* carrying the [*obj:COFFIN]. But this is only updated in the [~obj:SOUTH-TEMPLE]’s [code|~rtn:SOUTH-TEMPLE-FCN], because that’s the only room where it matters.
	Interestingly, there’s a comment on the northwest exit of the [~obj:DEEP-CANYON] which mentions this flag. This is left over from the MIT version of Zork, which had several other passages too narrow or steep to navigate with the coffin.

glob:XB: Set when you perform the [~obj:BELL] stage of the exorcism. See [~rtn:LLD-ROOM].

rtn:I-XB: Timer event after the [~obj:BELL] stage of the exorcism. When this fires, the exorcism fails.

glob:XC: Set when you perform the [~obj:CANDLES] stage of the exorcism. See [~rtn:LLD-ROOM].

rtn:I-XC: Timer event after the [~obj:CANDLES] stage of the exorcism. When this fires, the exorcism fails.

rtn:I-XBH: Timer event for the bell cooling down after the [~obj:BELL] stage of the exorcism.

glob:LLD-FLAG: Set when the Land of the Living Dead exorcism is complete. See [~rtn:LLD-ROOM].

obj:BAT: A reject from *Wumpus!* So said early versions of Zork, including the release I played in 1980. But here the reference has been deleted. Sigh.

obj:TIMBER-ROOM: The timbers are left over from an MIT Zork puzzle in which you had to anchor the rope at the top of the [~obj:SLIDE-ROOM] and lower yourself halfway down. The puzzle was dropped from this version of Zork, but a variation appeared in *Sorcerer*.

rtn:I-MAINT-ROOM: Timer event that floods the [~obj:MAINTENANCE-ROOM] when you push the wrong button.

rtn:I-REMPTY: Timer event for draining the [~obj:RESERVOIR].

rtn:I-RFILL: Timer event for refilling the [~obj:RESERVOIR].

rtn:I-RIVER: Timer event for the river current carrying you downstream.


rtn:PERFORM: Perform one game action. To simplify a bit, this sets up some globals ([~glob:PRSA], [~glob:PRSI], [~glob:PRSO]). Then it runs the action by invoking various handlers (drawn from the player, the location, the noun, the generic action table...) until one reports that the action is handled.
	Note that there are two complete implementations of `PERFORM` here. We observe that the first one is compiled and the second is ignored, based on the existence of the `PREDGEN` constant. I don’t know what that means, though.

src:GMAIN-143: We run the game’s “every turn” timers if the parser parsed a command ([*glob:P-WON]) and the command was not an out-of-world action (`SCORE`, `SAVE`, etc.)
	Curiously, the `TELL` action also skips the timers. Presumably the timers will run for the NPC’s commanded action. (But Zork 1 has no commandable NPCs, so this doesn’t come up.)

src:GVERBS-769: Jumping is fatal if the room has a down exit which is impassable (with a failure message). This makes sense for, say, [~obj:EAST-OF-CHASM]. It’s a bit odd in the [~obj:KITCHEN] or [~obj:RESERVOIR].

src:GVERBS-1813: This “floating over your head” check has to do with the `FLOAT` spell in Zork 2. That code is not used in Zork 1; that’s why it’s greyed out.

src:GVERBS-1848: Another Zork 2 spell (`FANTASIZE`) which has no effect in Zork 1. See [FLOAT|*src:GVERBS-1813], above.
	(Turns out the spell has no effect in [Zork 2|https://eblong.com/infocom/visi-zork2/#SRC:GVERBS-1712] either!)

src:GVERBS-1839: The “holding too many things” message is probabilistic. The more objects you have past [seven|~glob:fumble-number], the greater the [chance|~glob:fumble-prob] of failing to pick up another.
	Note that there’s a *separate* check, a few lines up, for whether “your load is too heavy”. That one is *not* probabilistic.
	I wrote a [blog post|https://blog.zarfhome.com/2017/08/your-load-is-too-heavy-zork-deep-reading] about this a few years back.

glob:fumble-number: See “[holding too many things|*src:GVERBS-1839]”.

rtn:V-WAIT: The `WAIT` command waits three full turns, including the “every turn” timers. But a timer can interrupt this – for example, if the thief shows up and robs you.

rtn:WEIGHT: Measure the total `SIZE` of an object, including its contents. (There is no separate “weight” property; `SIZE` describes both weight and bulk.)
	Anything the player is `WEAR`ing only counts as `SIZE` 1, regardless of contents. This simulates the fact that a backpack, for example, lets you carry more stuff. Sadly, Zork has no backpack, nor anything else you can `WEAR`.

rtn:I-CURE: Timer event for your wounds healing. Takes 30 turns per wound level.

glob:VILLAINS: The table of creatures you can fight. Each row shows: monster, weak-against, weakness penalty, awakening probability, combat outcomes table.
	That is, the [~obj:TROLL] is weaker against the [~obj:SWORD], with a -1 strength penalty if you’re using it.
	The “awakening probability” entry starts at zero when the monster is knocked out, and increases every turn until they wake up. (But the Visible Zorker does not currently display data table updates, so you can’t see this! Sorry.)

rtn:WINNING?: The thief compares your strength with his. Used to decide whether he flees combat.

rtn:FIGHT-STRENGTH: Determine your combat strength. This is initially 2, but increases to 7 as your score approaches 350.
	This can be adjusted by your `STRENGTH` property, which, like the comment says, is normally zero. When you are wounded, your `STRENGTH` is negative.

rtn:VILLAIN-STRENGTH: Determine the combat strength of an enemy. This is their `STRENGTH` property, with a couple of adjustments. The thief and troll are weaker against certain weapons (see [*glob:VILLAINS]), so their strength is decreased if the current action is `...WITH SWORD` or `...WITH KNIFE`.
	(Enemies have lower `STRENGTH` when wounded, and negative `STRENGTH` when unconscious.)
	
src:1ACTIONS-3333: This line is supposed to reduce the thief’s strength once after you give him a treasure. It never happens, though. See [*glob:THIEF-ENGROSSED].

glob:THIEF-ENGROSSED: Set if you have distracted the thief by giving him a treasure.
	*Bug:* This is also supposed to reduce his effective strength to 2 on the next blow (see [*rtn:VILLAIN-STRENGTH]). But it [turns out|https://intfiction.org/t/in-zork-i-does-thief-engrossed-actually-work/77855] that the flag is cleared by the “thief distracted” check. By the time he attacks you, his strength is back to normal!

src:1ACTIONS-3995: Surprisingly, it *is* possible to get killed while already dead. See [I-MAINT-ROOM|src:1ACTIONS-1318].

src:1ACTIONS-1318: You can drown in the [~obj:MAINTENANCE-ROOM] even if you’re [already dead|src:1ACTIONS-3995]! See [this forum post|https://intfiction.org/t/causes-of-zombification-in-zork-i-and-possibly-other-infocom-games/53439/27].

glob:DROWNINGS: The last two entries in this table are never printed. The water is “up to your neck” when [~glob:WATER-LEVEL] is 13 (the value is [divided by two|~src:1ACTIONS-1318]), and then you drown at 14. The final entries are left over from MIT Zork.
